The SRA Toolkit provides 64-bit binary installations for the Ubuntu and CentOS Linux distributions, for Mac OS X, and for Windows.

The current binaries for:

OS	are available here
Windows	sratoolkit.current-win64.zip
Ubuntu	sratoolkit.current-ubuntu64.tar.gz
CentOS	sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz
Mac OS X	sratoolkit.current-mac64.tar.gz
For installing on Windows:

Download the zip file from the link given above
Extract it to your desktop, for example
Open a command shell, for example Start/Run cmd.exe
cd to the directory you extracted the zip file to, for example Desktop
cd bin
Test that the toolkit is functional:
fastq-dump --stdout -X 2 SRR390728
Within a few seconds, the command should produce this exact output (and nothing else):

The installation processes for Mac OS X and the two Linux distributions are roughly identical.

1. Fetch the tar file from the canonical location at NCBI:

For Ubuntu,
wget --output-document sratoolkit.tar.gz http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-ubuntu64.tar.gz
For CentOS,
wget --output-document sratoolkit.tar.gz http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz
For Mac OS X, (or use wget if you prefer)
curl --output sratoolkit.tar.gz http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-mac64.tar.gz
2. Extract the contents of the tar file:

tar -vxzf sratoolkit.tar.gz
Note the name of the directory that tar created. The name of this directory changes with each release and varies by platform, i.e. it follows the pattern sratoolkit.<release>-<platform> e.g. sratoolkit.2.4.0-1-mac64 for the 2.4.0-1 release for Mac OS X.

3. For convenience (and to show you where the binaries are) append the path to the binaries to your PATH environment variable:
Add this path to your .bashrc

export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/sratoolkit.2.5.7-ubuntu64/bin

source .bashrc

4. Verify that the binaries will be found by the shell:

which fastq-dump
This should produce output similar to:

/Users/JoeUser/sratoolkit.2.4.0-1.mac64/bin/fastq-dump
5. Test that the toolkit is functional:

fastq-dump --stdout SRR390728 | head -n 8
Within a few seconds, the command should produce this exact output (and nothing else):

@SRR390728.1 1 length=72
CATTCTTCACGTAGTTCTCGAGCCTTGGTTTTCAGCGATGGAGAATGACTTTGACAAGCTGAGAGAAGNTNC
+SRR390728.1 1 length=72

The SRA Toolkit and SDK from NCBI is a collection of tools and libraries for
using data in the INSDC Sequence Read Archives.

Much of the data submitted these days contain alignment information, for example
in BAM, Illumina export.txt, and Complete Genomics formats. With aligned data,
NCBI uses Compression by Reference, which only stores the differences in base
pairs between sequence data and the segment it aligns to.  The process to
restore original data, for example as FastQ, requires fast access to the
reference sequences that the original data was aligned to.  NCBI recommends that
SRA users dedicate local disk space to store references downloaded from the NCBI
SRA site.  As of February 2015, the complete collection of these reference sequences
is 98 GB.  While it isn't usually necessary to download the entirety of the
reference sequences, this should give you an idea of the scale of the storage
requirement.  By default, the Toolkit will download missing reference sequences
on demand and cache them in the user's home directory.  The location of this
cache is configurable, as is whether the download is automatic or manual.

For additional information on using, configuring, and building the toolkit,
